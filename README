Idea
Competative games develop "meta-games" when players develop certain strategies to beat other strategies.  A healthy meta-game creates a large number of stable niches for players to fill, while an unhealthy meta might allow only 1 viable strategy.  In reality, meta-games tend to shift quickly from archetype to archetype as players race to outwit one another.  The analysis from a player perspective often amounts to little more than rock-paper-sissors.  Strategy X beats strategy Y, and Strategy Y is popular, so I play strategy X.

This tool is intended to "solve" the meta-game based on statistical observation of the matchups of all visible strategies.

Framework
The fundamental assumption is that, in a stable meta game, all strategies have a 50% win rate.  The density of each viable strategy is determined to comply with that constraint.

Any strategy that is worse in every matchup than another strategy is not viable.

The degenerate case occurs when one strategy dominates utterly, and only faces itself in a stable metagame.
